<h4> Programming Skills section </h4>
<ul>
  <li> I took 2 semester of Computer Science and I learned about Java. We used the software called Eclipse to learn about it. Although I took 2 years of Computer Science, I would still consider my skills to be beginner. That is because I had a hard time understanding the professors as they were very unclear. </li>
